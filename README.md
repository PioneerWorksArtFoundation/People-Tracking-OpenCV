## Installation

### Installing Pip

If you don't already have the `pip` package manager installed on your computer, you'll need to install it so that you can easy install all of the dependencies for this project. In general, you can use the [instructions here on installing with get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Mac/Linux users can alternatively use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install pip with `brew install pip`.

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have pip installed, clone this repository onto your system. `cd` into the root directory of this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the requirements necessary.

One of the requirements, `dlib`, requires that you have a separate tool called [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your system. Mac/Linus users with Homebrew can `brew install cmake`. Otherwise, see the [CMake Downloads page](https://cmake.org/download/) for more information.
